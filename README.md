# Analysis of Census Income Dataset
In this project report we have a summary of our analysis and exploration of the Adult Census Data to come up with meaningful, important and interesting attributes of the data. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes we have performed a predictive task of classification, whether income exceeds $50K/yr. based on given features, such as age, education, occupation, gender, race, etc. Finally, we found the classifier with the highest prediction accuracy by conducting performance evaluation using ROC curves and AUC.

# Data Set
The Census Dataset is provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is in the data folder. It contains adult.data for training and adult.test for testing. It describes 15 variables on a sample of individuals from the US Census database. Please see [UCI Website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) for more details and attribute information.

# Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forest
- Neural Network classifier
- Naive Bayes calssifier
- KNN classifier
- SVMs

# Result
The Neural Network is the strongest classifier of the seven methods. The Random Forest classifier also gives very high prediction accuracy on test set. Please see the Report for more details.
